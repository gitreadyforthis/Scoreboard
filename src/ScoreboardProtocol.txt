Server Starts with opening an SSL port Using TLS, Listening for any connections.
Upon Connection a new thread is created and the user connects to the server through that thread.
The first thing the User needs is to establish a User Name for identification upon the ScoreBoard.
After Inputing the User Name the User will have a few options to choose from. 

The commands are: 

Help-which displays the commands that are available to the user
The syntax is:	help

Game-The user can choose a game to play	

	The default games that come with this package are "crypto" and "networking"
	After choosing a game then the question is number is excepted which is 0 or 1.
	This is based on their arraylisting within the program. After choosing a question then 
	The answer is needed to which the user provides an answer then they are brought back to the main menu
The syntax is:  game
		choosen game
		0 or 1
		Question appears and user answers question
		returns to main menu		 
		

	If you want to add another game to the play you will need to access the code
	and manually add the games you want to add within the main.
The syntax to be looked at for: 	ChallengeResponseGame <gameName>= new ChallengeResponseGame("gameName");
		gameName.addQuestion(new Question("questionNumber","Question","Answer",points));

	
	You will need to access the code  and increase the  the qchoice value to a value one 
	more then the total questions that would be avaialabe to each game. The default is 2 
	questions per game but you wanted to add more then the qChoice value will need to increase.
The syntax to be looked at for:	int qChoice=2;	if(qChoice == 0||qChoice == 1)

the usernames while the server is still running.

The syntax is:	questions
		All questions are listed


Similar to the qChoice the value of the the games and questions avaiable need to be increased for the addition of
